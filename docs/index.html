        <p class="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-center">
            This Privacy Policy describes how Jobfluxor ("we," "our," or "the Extension") collects, uses, and handles your personal information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency in our data practices.

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 border-b-2 pb-2">1. Information We Collect</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                The Extension is designed to function entirely on your local device. It may collect personal information that you provide to it directly, such as:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
                <li>
                    <strong>Job application data:</strong> This includes information you enter into a form for automating job applications on LinkedIn, such as your name, contact information, work history, and resume information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Interaction data:</strong> Information about how you interact with the Extension's user interface to facilitate its core functionality, such as button clicks and form field changes.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 border-b-2 pb-2">2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Your information is used solely to provide the core functionality of the Extension. For example, your data is processed to automatically fill in forms for "easy apply" jobs on LinkedIn to streamline the application process. The information is used to improve the automation and provide a better user experience.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 font-bold leading-relaxed">
                We do not transmit, store, or process any of your personal information on our servers or any third-party servers.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                All data collected by the Extension remains on your local machine and is not accessible to us or anyone else.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="space-y-6">
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 border-b-2 pb-2">3. Data Storage and Security</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                All data collected by the Extension is stored locally in your browser's **localStorage**. This data is not sent to us or any third parties. It is protected by the security of your local browser and device.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Because the data is stored locally, it is important to note that if you clear your browser's data, the Extension's data may also be permanently deleted.
            </p>

        <section class="space-y-6">
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 border-b-2 pb-2">4. Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                The Extension does not use any third-party services that collect or process your personal information.
            </p>

        <section class="space-y-6">
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 border-b-2 pb-2">5. Your Choices</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Since your data is stored locally, you have full control over it. You can delete the data at any time by clearing your browser's data or by uninstalling the Extension.
